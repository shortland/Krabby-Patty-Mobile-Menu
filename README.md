"Hamburger-Menu" designs are pretty common nowadays. This is another one of those, simple and easy to use.

Minimal simple code.


Inspiration came from: https://github.com/ymc-thzi/mobile-menu-hamburger

After struggling with the limitations and out-dated version of the mobile menu I had been using; I decided to give my own menu a go. The outcome was a similar menu to that, that appears on Apple's mobile website.
